# occlusion_prevention
This repo is the modification of track.py file of YOLOv5 models, where I use orb and sift features between sequence of frames to prevent occlusion by putting threshold on total number of matches

I modified the track.py file in the available github repositories on yolov5+deepsort, which builds boxes on each video frame and assigns id to each object.
